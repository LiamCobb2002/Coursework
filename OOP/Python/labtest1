The first part of this programme allows the user to select from a
list of numbers, this input is only allowed if it is a digit and between 0 and 3.

The second half of this programme is a game in which the player
must guess the correct digits in the hidden number.
When all 3 digits are guessed correctly  then victory message appears
along with the winning number
